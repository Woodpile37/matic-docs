JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that is commonly used for interacting with the Polygon network layer. Polygon JSON-RPC methods allow developers to query for data, write to the blockchain, and build dApps.

## API Documentation

To get started with the API, visit the complete set of API documentation for standard [Polygon JSON-RPC calls](https://edge-docs.polygon.technology/docs/get-started/json-rpc-commands/).

## No-Code API Requests

If you want to get started with API requests that require no set-up, fix failing requests, or, explore new methods on the Polygon network, try out the [Composer App](https://composer.alchemyapi.io?composer_state=%7B%22chain%22%3A2%2C%22network%22%3A401%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getBlockByNumber%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%22latest%22%2Cfalse%5D%7D).
